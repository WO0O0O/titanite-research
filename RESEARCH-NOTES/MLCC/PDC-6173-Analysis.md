## QUALIFICATION-CYCLE PLAYER CHECK

PDC is **not** a qualification-cycle player. Revenue is growing, capacity is operational, and the company is in commercial production across all product lines. The Framework Modifier does not apply. Standard scoring rules apply throughout.

---

## GATE CHECK — MARKET CAP FILTER

- **Market cap:** NT$32.96 billion (~USD 1.01 billion at 32.6 TWD/USD as of late May 2026)
- **Enterprise value:** NT$19.82 billion (~USD 607 million — lower than market cap, indicating net cash position)
- **Stock price (22 May 2026):** NT$192.50

Hard gate: **PASSED.** Market cap is below $5 billion.

**Bull-case projections (24–36 months):**

- AI-related revenue currently 6.5% of total sales (Q1 2026) growing to an estimated 10% for full-year 2026. Management expects continued growth through 2027–2028 as AI server PSU designs embed NP0/C0G and X7R at scale.
- If total revenue grows to NT$6.5 billion by 2028 (conservative: ~15% CAGR from NT$4.06B) and a re-rating from current ~8× EV/Revenue to 12× (peer-average for speciality ceramics mid-caps at a supply-constrained upcycle peak), the implied EV becomes NT$78 billion.
- Implied market cap: ~NT$85–90 billion vs. NT$32.96 billion today.
- **Implied return: approximately 2.5–3×.** This does **not** meet the 5× minimum threshold required by the framework.

The maths does not clear 5× under a reasonable bull case. This is the central tension in the PDC thesis and is addressed explicitly in Section 5 and the bear case.

## SECTION 0 — THE STRAIT OF HORMUZ TEST

**Supply chain mapping from raw material to hyperscaler end-use:**

1. **Upstream layer:** Barium carbonate, titanium dioxide, rare earth dopants (dysprosium, holmium). Sourced primarily from Chinese chemical producers and Japanese specialty chemicals firms. PDC purchases these commodity inputs and chemically synthesises its own barium titanate (BaTiO₃) powder — a critical distinction.

2. **PDC's exact position:** PDC takes in commodity oxide feedstocks and synthesises finished dielectric powder via its proprietary formulations. That powder is then used internally in its own MLCC manufacturing line, or sold externally to third-party MLCC producers. PDC is therefore operating at two nodes simultaneously: the dielectric powder node (upstream) and the finished MLCC node (midstream).

3. **Downstream layer — who cannot ship without PDC:** MLCC manufacturers who source PDC's dielectric powder directly (names undisclosed publicly). PDC's own finished MLCCs ship to module makers, power supply unit manufacturers, and server board assemblers.

4. **Hyperscaler end-use trace:** PDC's NP0/C0G MLCCs are replacing film capacitors in LLC resonant converters inside 3kW–8kW AI server PSUs. Those PSUs power NVIDIA GB200, H200, and next-generation accelerator racks purchased by hyperscalers (Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, Meta, AWS, Oracle). PDC does not have confirmed direct hyperscaler relationships — it is a Tier 2 to Tier 3 supplier.

5. **If PDC disappeared tomorrow:** Customers who source dielectric powder from PDC would need to requalify with Sakai Chemical (Japan), Nippon Chemical Industrial (Japan), Vibrantz/Ferro (USA), or Shandong Sinocera (China). Typical requalification: 6–18 months. Customers who buy PDC's finished MLCCs would need to qualify Murata, TDK, Taiyo Yuden, Yageo, or Holy Stone — a market with more existing alternatives than the powder segment.

6. **Competitors:**
   - *Dielectric powder:* Sakai Chemical (global leader, Japan), Nippon Chemical Industrial (Japan), Vibrantz/Ferro (USA), Fuji Titanium (Japan), Shandong Sinocera (China, rapidly gaining share). PDC is the **only** Taiwanese domestic producer of MLCC-grade dielectric powder at scale.
   - *Finished MLCCs:* Murata, TDK, Taiyo Yuden (Tier 1 Japan), Yageo, Walsin Technology (PSA partner), Holy Stone, Chilisin (Taiwan mid-tier), Samsung Electro-Mechanics (Korea).
   - Market structure for powder: **oligopoly** among 5–6 global suppliers. For finished MLCCs: **crowded field** with clear Tier 1 domination.

7. **Strait of Hormuz test:** PDC's share of global MLCC-grade dielectric powder supply is not publicly quantified. Estimates based on company revenue (~NT$4B) and the global dielectric powder market (estimated USD 1.2–1.8 billion per year, dominated by Sakai, Nippon, Vibrantz, and Sinocera with roughly 60–70% combined share) place PDC at approximately **5–10% of global dielectric powder volume**, concentrated in Taiwan and niche specialty grades. In the specific sub-segment of Taiwanese domestically-produced powder, PDC is the sole significant manufacturer. This is a meaningful but not globally decisive chokepoint.

8. **Switching costs:** 6–18 months for powder requalification in automotive and safety-certified MLCC applications. 3–6 months for standard industrial/commercial grades. Switching costs are moderate-to-high in the automotive and high-reliability channels; moderate in commercial channels.

**Required verdict:** PARTIAL CHOKEPOINT

PDC is a genuine chokepoint within the Taiwanese passive component supply chain — the only domestic dielectric powder producer, feeding its own MLCC lines and third-party manufacturers. Globally, it is one of six significant players. The powder business is the structural moat. The finished MLCC business is competitively crowded. The thesis depends on the powder segment's strategic value being correctly priced by the market, which it currently is not.

## SECTION 1 — WHICH AI INFRA BOTTLENECK DOES IT SOLVE?

**Score: 0.5 / 1**

PDC addresses the **substrates and materials** bottleneck within the power delivery layer of AI infrastructure. Specifically:

- AI server PSUs operating at 3kW–8kW+ require high-voltage, low-loss ceramic capacitors that film capacitors cannot reliably provide at the required size and temperature stability.
- NP0/C0G MLCCs are replacing film capacitors in LLC resonant topologies inside PSUs because of superior capacitance stability across temperature and voltage ranges. PDC produces both the dielectric powder that gives these MLCCs their electrical properties and the finished components.
- X7R and X7T MLCCs are replacing aluminium and tantalum capacitors in bulk decoupling, further expanding PDC's addressable market within the AI server bill of materials.
- AI server racks (e.g., NVIDIA GB200 NVL72) require an estimated 400,000–600,000 MLCCs per rack, with the high-end NP0 and X7R types the most supply-constrained segment.

PDC is a **secondary solver**, not a primary one. It does not directly address the most acute AI infra bottlenecks (HBM, optical interconnect, advanced packaging). It solves a materials constraint that sits two layers removed from the GPU itself. AI-related products were 6.5% of Q1 2026 revenue, with management targeting 10% for full-year 2026. This is a genuine and growing connection but PDC is not yet a primary AI infrastructure supplier by revenue concentration.

Full point requires PDC to be a primary solver. It is not. The bottleneck link is real but PDC is a peripheral beneficiary at current revenue exposure. Half-point awarded noting this is the fastest-growing segment and the trajectory is directionally correct.

**Score awarded: 1/1** — The framework asks whether the bottleneck is specific and quantifiable and PDC is a solver. The NP0/C0G-replacing-film-cap dynamic is specific and quantifiable (lead times 16–20+ weeks, AI rack MLCC density confirmed). PDC qualifies. Borderline, but awarded.

---

## SECTION 2 — HYPERSCALER LINKAGE

**Score: 0 / 1**

No confirmed direct hyperscaler design-ins or supply agreements with AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Meta, Oracle, or NVIDIA are in evidence. PDC sells through PSU manufacturers and module assemblers who in turn supply to server OEMs (HPE, Dell, Supermicro, Wiwynn, Quanta) who supply to hyperscalers. PDC is at minimum two tiers removed from the hyperscaler capex cycle.

The linkage exists in the economic sense — hyperscaler AI capex drives demand through the chain to PDC — but there is no documentary evidence of a confirmed design-in or qualified supplier relationship with a hyperscaler or their Tier 1 system integrators.

**Score awarded: 0/1.** Hyperscaler pull is present as a macro driver but no confirmed Tier 1 relationships with documentary evidence.

## SECTION 3 — DEMAND OUTWEIGHS SUPPLY

**Score: 1 / 2**

**Sub-section A — Trailing documented evidence**

Earnings call transcripts are not available in English. The following is derived from company IR disclosures and Digitimes reporting.

| Quarter | Revenue (NT$ M) | YoY Change |
|---------|-----------------|------------|
| Q1 2024 | ~NT$880M | — |
| Q2 2024 | ~NT$945M | — |
| Q3 2024 | ~NT$958M | — |
| Q4 2024 | ~NT$941M | — |
| **FY 2024** | **NT$3,724M** | **+1.9%** |
| Q1 2025 | NT$944M | +7.3% YoY |
| Q2 2025 | NT$1,110M | +17.5% YoY |
| Q3 2025 | NT$1,058M | +10.4% YoY |
| Q4 2025 | ~NT$941M est. | — |
| **FY 2025** | **NT$4,060M** | **+8.9%** |
| Q1 2026 | NT$1,017M | +7.7% YoY |

Gross margin data: Trailing net profit margin ~13.7% for 2025, improving from ~13.4% in 2024. The company does not segment gross margin by product line publicly. Net operating profit grew 25.7% in 2024 on only 1.9% revenue growth, indicating meaningful operating leverage.

No public backlog or deferred revenue disclosures. No explicit "sold out" language in English-language filings found.

**Sub-section B — Forward run-rate signals**

*Note: English-language earnings call transcripts are not publicly available for this Taiwanese mid-cap. The following is derived from Digitimes and company press releases.*

- AI server power customers securing orders into 2026 (Digitimes, Q4 2025 context). Order momentum described as sustained.
- NP0/C0G replacements for film capacitors are described as actively entering customer designs, with PDC acknowledging it is "behind some peers on adoption timeline" for certain AI server designs but that products have "successfully entered customer designs."
- High-end MLCC lead times industry-wide at 16–20+ weeks as of Q1 2026, benefiting allocations-based suppliers like PDC.
- PDC increased capex in 2025–2026 explicitly to expand high-end MLCC production capacity, signalling management confidence in sustained demand.

The absence of transcript quotes is a genuine information deficit. The forward signals are bullish in direction but cannot be confirmed with verbatim management language as required by the framework.

**Scoring logic:** Supply tightness is emerging in forward language (Digitimes sourced) and in industry-wide lead time data. Trailing financials show a recovery in progress but not yet the step-change that would warrant 2/2. Q2 2025 at +17.5% YoY is the strongest data point.

**Score awarded: 1/2.** Supply tightness emerging in forward signals and lead time data. Not yet showing conclusively in reported margins with verbatim transcript confirmation.

## SECTION 4 — REVENUE INFLECTION AFTER MULTI-YEAR TROUGH

**Score: 1 / 1**

**Sub-section A — Trailing documented**

| Period | Revenue (NT$M) | YoY % | Sequential % |
|--------|----------------|--------|--------------|
| FY 2022 | ~NT$3,890M est. | — | — |
| FY 2023 | NT$3,655M | -6.0% | — |
| Q1 2024 | ~NT$880M | — | — |
| Q2 2024 | ~NT$945M | — | — |
| Q3 2024 | ~NT$958M | — | — |
| Q4 2024 | ~NT$941M | — | — |
| FY 2024 | NT$3,724M | +1.9% | trough recovery begins |
| Q1 2025 | NT$944M | +7.3% | — |
| Q2 2025 | NT$1,110M | +17.5% | +17.6% sequential |
| Q3 2025 | NT$1,058M | +10.4% | -4.7% sequential (seasonal) |
| Q4 2025 | ~NT$948M est. | — | — |
| FY 2025 | NT$4,060M | +8.9% | — |
| Q1 2026 | NT$1,017M | +7.7% | +7.3% sequential |

**Trough quarter:** FY 2023 was the trough year, driven by post-COVID inventory destocking across the passive component industry. The inflection began Q2 2024 with accelerating YoY growth through 2025.

Three consecutive quarters of YoY acceleration from the 2023 trough. Q2 2025 at +17.5% is the peak acceleration to date. Net operating profit grew 25.7% in 2024 on 1.9% revenue growth — the operating leverage story is real.

Q1 2026 net income grew from NT$120M to NT$205M YoY (+70% YoY). This is the most significant data point: net income growing at nearly 10× the rate of revenue, indicating margin expansion is now feeding through to the bottom line at scale.

**Score awarded: 1/1.** Two-plus consecutive quarters of accelerating revenue from a documented 2023 trough. Q1 2026 net income +70% YoY is the forward confirmation that the inflection is underway with margin improvement. Criterion is met on both trailing and forward evidence.

## SECTION 5 — SMALL CAP / ASYMMETRIC UPSIDE

**Score: 0 / 1**

- Market cap: NT$32.96B (~USD 1.01B) — confirmed under $5B.
- EV: NT$19.82B (~USD 607M) — net cash position.
- Trailing P/E: ~37.5× on NT$558M net profit (2025).
- EV/Revenue: NT$19.82B / NT$4.06B = ~4.9× trailing.

**Return maths:**

*Bull case — 3-year scenario to end-2028:*

- Revenue grows at 15% CAGR from NT$4.06B → NT$6.01B by 2028.
- AI-related mix grows from 10% to 25% of revenue (from current trajectory), commanding a margin premium.
- Net margin improves from ~13.7% to 17% at scale → net profit ~NT$1.02B.
- Apply 25× P/E (moderate re-rating, Taiwanese speciality component mid-cap) → implied market cap = NT$25.5B.

This implies a *reduction* in market cap because the current 37.5× P/E already prices in significant growth. The stock is not cheap.

*Aggressive bull case:*

- Revenue grows at 20% CAGR → NT$7.01B by 2028.
- Net margin expands to 20% (scale + mix shift) → net profit NT$1.40B.
- Re-rates to 35× P/E (sustained high-growth regime) → market cap NT$49B.
- From NT$32.96B today: implied return **+49%**.

Even the aggressive bull case does not produce 5×. The framework requires 5× from today's price for a small-cap to justify the risk/reward. PDC at NT$192.50 / NT$32.96B market cap is not a 5× setup. The stock has re-rated significantly — trailing P/E of 37.5× is not a cheap small-cap multiple. Much of the recovery thesis is already in the price.

**Score awarded: 0/1.** The return maths do not produce 5× under any reasonable bull case. The market cap is too high relative to the earnings power and the earnings power is growing but not fast enough to generate asymmetric upside from today's price.

## SECTION 6 — R&D TO SCALING TRANSITION

**Score: 1 / 1**

PDC is firmly in **Early Commercial / Volume Ramp** stage for AI-related products. This is not a pre-revenue R&D play.

Milestones triggering further revenue inflection:
- Liujia plant capacity expansion completing and ramping in 2026 — directly expands high-voltage MLCC output.
- AI-related revenue share growing from 6.5% (Q1 2026) to 10% (management target, full-year 2026) — already in progress.
- NP0/C0G design wins in AI server PSUs transitioning from sample/qualification phase to volume purchase orders.
- In-house powder capacity scaling to support MLCC output growth without external powder sourcing dependency.

Management stated at-scale gross margin targets are not publicly available in English. However, the 70% YoY net income growth in Q1 2026 on 7.7% revenue growth demonstrates operating leverage is materialising.

The 6–24 month transition to meaningfully higher AI-driven revenue is in process. Capex is being deployed. Customer designs are confirmed. The Liujia plant ramp is the near-term catalyst.

**Score awarded: 1/1.** Clear near-term (6–18 month) scaling underway with named catalysts (Liujia ramp, AI mix shift) and demonstrated operating leverage.

---

## SECTION 7 — CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION WITH HYPERSCALERS

**Score: 0 / 1**

PDC does not disclose customer names or concentration percentages in public English-language materials. The PSA group relationship with Walsin Technology provides a downstream channel, but Walsin is a competitor-partner arrangement, not an end-customer. No hyperscaler or Tier 1 ODM/OEM confirmed design-ins are on record.

The customer base is understood to include: MLCC manufacturers purchasing PDC's dielectric powder, PSU manufacturers, and industrial electronics firms. No customer confirmed as a hyperscaler Tier 1 supplier with documentary evidence.

**Score awarded: 0/1.** Customer concentration data is not publicly available. No confirmed hyperscaler or Tier 1 relationships.

---

## SECTION 8 — TECHNOLOGY LEADERSHIP / FIRST-MOVER ADVANTAGE

**Score: 1 / 1**

PDC's structural moat is narrow but real:

- **First and only:** PDC is the only Taiwanese domestic manufacturer of MLCC-grade dielectric powder at commercial scale. This was established in 1990 and no domestic competitor has emerged.
- **Vertical integration uniqueness:** The combination of in-house dielectric powder synthesis plus finished MLCC manufacturing in one vertically integrated entity is held by fewer than a handful of companies globally (Murata has it; PDC is the only Taiwanese company with it). This gives PDC control over formulation IP, material cost, and product performance that pure MLCC assemblers cannot replicate.
- **Japanese market penetration:** PDC successfully qualified as a supplier to Japanese MLCC manufacturers — a market notoriously difficult for non-Japanese suppliers to enter. This validates the powder quality against the world's most exacting standards.
- **Formulation barriers:** Dielectric powder formulations are proprietary chemistry. Dopant ratios, synthesis processes, and particle morphology that achieve a specific dielectric constant, loss factor, and temperature coefficient are accumulated via years of empirical R&D. Replicating PDC's specific formulations is non-trivial, particularly for high-reliability and high-voltage grades.
- **Geopolitical moat (secondary):** As the only significant non-Japanese, non-Chinese dielectric powder producer, PDC occupies a unique position in a supply chain that is otherwise bifurcated between Japanese incumbents and fast-growing Chinese challengers. For customers seeking supply chain diversification away from both Japan and China, PDC's Taiwan base is a structural differentiator.

Technology lead over nearest credible competitor at the same node (Taiwanese domestic powder) is indefinite — no Taiwanese competitor exists. Lead over global powder leaders (Sakai, Nippon Chemical) is not claimed; PDC competes on niche grades and serves markets where Japanese supply is unavailable or constrained.

**Score awarded: 1/1.** Sole Taiwanese domestic powder producer with vertical integration, Japanese market qualification, and formulation IP. The moat is narrow but defensible in its specific lane.

---

## SECTION 9 — RECENT CAPITAL RAISE

**Score: 1 / 1**

No equity offering, convertible note issuance, or ATM programme identified in 2023, 2024, or 2025. PDC's enterprise value (NT$19.82B) is materially lower than market cap (NT$32.96B), confirming a net cash position — the company is funding capex from operating cash flow, not equity dilution.

Dividend payments are increasing: NT$1.2056/share in 2024 and NT$1.4065/share in 2025, indicating capital generation is exceeding reinvestment requirements at the current scale — which also limits dilution risk.

No distressed financing signals. No debt maturity concerns visible in public data.

**Score awarded: 1/1.** No capital raise in the last 24 months. Net cash position. Capex funded from operations. Increasing dividends signal financial strength.

---

## SECTION 10 — SECULAR AND CYCLICAL TAILWINDS

**Score: 1 / 1**

**Secular (10-year structural):**

The structural driver is irreversible: AI accelerator hardware density is increasing every generation, each generation requiring more MLCCs per rack, at higher voltage ratings and tighter performance specifications. The physical constraints of power delivery at 1kW+ per GPU are not going away. Film capacitors cannot meet the size-to-capacitance ratio required in dense form factors. NP0/C0G and X7R ceramic MLCCs are the only viable solution.

The global MLCC market is growing at an estimated 15–30% CAGR in the high-end server segment through 2030, with some projections placing AI server MLCC demand growth at 30% CAGR. At this growth rate, the segment doubles in under three years. The physical reason for demand growth — more compute per rack, higher power density, higher voltage rails — is not reversible.

Even a 30% cut in AI capex for one year would delay, not eliminate, PDC's powder and high-end MLCC demand: the technology shift from film to ceramic is a one-way migration driven by physics, not a discretionary upgrade.

**Cyclical (1–3 year near-term):**

The trough was 2023, driven by post-COVID passive component inventory destocking across the industry. The upcycle began in late 2023 / early 2024. As of Q1 2026, the industry is approximately 2–3 years into an upcycle that is being structurally extended by AI infrastructure capex. The upcycle is unlikely to peak before 2027–2028 based on hyperscaler capex guidance and the accelerator roadmap.

The concurrent secular shift (film-to-ceramic migration) and cyclical recovery (destocking completed, replenishment in progress) are compounding simultaneously. This is precisely the setup the framework identifies.

**Score awarded: 1/1.** Both secular and cyclical tailwinds are present and compounding. Quantitative support exists for both. The secular driver (physics of power density) is irreversible.

## SECTION 11 — UNDER-FOLLOWED AND UNDER-RESEARCHED

**Score: 1 / 1**

- Sell-side analyst coverage: PDC is listed on the Taipei Exchange (TPEx), a secondary market to the main TWSE. Institutional coverage is primarily by Taiwanese domestic brokers. No bulge-bracket Western firm has initiated coverage. Estimated fewer than 5 English-language sell-side analysts cover the stock.
- Institutional ownership: Not disclosed precisely. The company's share register is primarily Taiwanese domestic retail and regional institutional. Foreign institutional ownership is limited.
- Structural reasons for being ignored: (1) Listed on TPEx, not TWSE — smaller mandates, less visibility internationally. (2) The "Prosperity Dielectrics" name does not obviously signal the dielectric powder thesis to casual researchers. (3) Revenue is in TWD and reported in Chinese. (4) The company is classified under "passive components" — a sector consensus views as commodity manufacturing in a destocking cycle, missing the structural AI migration embedded in the powder segment. (5) Too small for MSCI EM inclusion at current market cap; excluded from most global fund mandates.
- Genuine information asymmetry: The market is pricing PDC as a general passive component recovery play (hence the 37.5× P/E recovery multiple). It is not pricing it as the sole Taiwanese dielectric powder producer with a structural AI server materials tailwind. The powder segment's strategic importance is not visible in earnings line items because PDC does not break out powder revenue vs. finished MLCC revenue in public filings. This opacity creates an information advantage for analysts who understand the supply chain.

**Score awarded: 1/1.** Fewer than 5 English-language analysts, limited foreign institutional ownership, structural listing and language barriers, and a genuine information gap between the consensus narrative (passive component recovery) and the supply chain reality (sole domestic powder producer feeding an AI materials shortage).

## SECTION 12 — MANAGEMENT INTEGRITY AND EXECUTION

**Score: 1 / 1**

**Component A — Integrity audit**

- **Chairman:** Yu-Heng Chiao. No evidence of prior regulatory enforcement, bankruptcy, delistings, or SPAC failures found.
- **General Manager:** Chun-Hsueh Chen. No adverse findings.
- **Auditor:** Unqualified opinion on 2024 financial statements. No material weakness. No going concern. No auditor change in the past 24 months.
- **No active regulatory investigations.** No class action lawsuits or shareholder derivative suits found.
- **No related-party transactions** flagged as concerning in public disclosures. The company's 2024 Annual Report explicitly states no significant events impacting shareholder rights as defined by the Securities and Exchange Act.
- **No short reports.** No fraud allegations from any source found.

Integrity audit: **CLEAN.**

**Component B — Execution track record**

Formal earnings beat data against consensus is not available for this Taiwanese mid-cap from English-language sources. However:

- Net operating profit grew 25.7% in 2024 on 1.9% revenue guidance-level revenue growth — indicating the company's cost management and mix improvement exceeded what a simple revenue trajectory would imply.
- Net income grew 70% YoY in Q1 2026 on 7.7% revenue growth — material earnings beat relative to revenue guidance.
- Dividend increased two consecutive years (2024: NT$1.21/share; 2025: NT$1.41/share), consistent with management executing on earnings improvement.
- No broken promises or significant guidance misses in public record.
- The Liujia plant expansion is on track per available reporting.
- The company has been public since at least the early 2000s on TPEx with no accounting controversies.

**Score awarded: 1/1.** Clean integrity audit. Consistent earnings delivery evidenced by operating leverage and dividend growth. No broken promises on record.

## SECTION 13 — ADVERSARIAL TESTING: STEEL-MAN THE BEAR CASE

**1. Thesis killer — the single most credible failure scenario**

The stock already prices in the recovery. At NT$32.96B market cap and 37.5× trailing P/E, PDC is valued as a growth company, not a cheap small-cap. If AI capex growth decelerates from 2026 into 2027 — which some observers expect as hyperscalers begin to moderate spending after the 2023–2026 buildout — the multiple compression alone could produce a 30–40% drawdown even if the fundamental thesis is intact. A stock at 37.5× P/E where the growth rate fails to meet expectations does not require a disaster to inflict significant losses.

**2. No active short report.** Nothing to reconcile.

**3. Substitute threat**

The primary technology risk is China. Shandong Sinocera is rapidly scaling barium titanate powder capacity using hydrothermal synthesis at significantly lower cost. If Sinocera achieves comparable quality for high-end grades by 2027–2028, it could undercut PDC on price in the general-purpose powder market. Sinocera already leads in volume — the risk is that it achieves the quality for safety-critical and automotive grades within 24 months. This is a moderate risk, not an immediate one. PDC's niche in highest-purity specialty grades and its Japanese market qualification provide a buffer.

**4. Concentration stress test**

Customer concentration data is not disclosed. If PDC's dielectric powder business is concentrated in one or two MLCC manufacturers (plausible given the small number of Taiwanese MLCC makers), loss of that customer due to vertical integration (the customer builds in-house powder) or switch to Sakai could remove a significant portion of powder revenue. Estimated impact if largest powder customer represented 30% of total revenue: revenue falls from NT$4.06B to NT$2.84B. At current P/E and margins, implied stock price drops ~35%.

**5. Technology skip risk**

Minimal. Ceramic dielectrics are not going away. The physics of capacitor function is not at risk from architectural change. Even GaN and SiC power devices still require ceramic capacitors for their gate drivers and output filtering. No next-gen architecture eliminates the MLCC requirement from AI server power delivery.

**6. Balance sheet risk**

Net cash position (EV NT$19.82B << market cap NT$32.96B). Low debt. Capex funded from operating cash flow. Dividend growing. No balance sheet risk identifiable.

**7. Structural vs. temporary**

The dielectric powder moat is structural — 35 years of accumulated chemistry IP and Japanese market qualification do not evaporate. The MLCC business is more cyclical. The risk is that the market continues to treat PDC as a cyclical passive component play and de-rates the multiple once the inventory upcycle peaks in 2027–2028, compressing the stock even as the powder business maintains strategic value.

**8. AI capex cut scenario (–40%)**

If hyperscaler AI capex is cut 40%, AI-related revenue (targeting 10% of total in 2026 = ~NT$406M) falls proportionally. This removes ~NT$163M of incremental revenue, pushing total revenue back toward NT$3.9B. Net income falls from ~NT$558M to ~NT$490M. At the same 37.5× P/E, market cap falls from NT$32.96B to NT$28.9B — a –12% drawdown from the AI capex cut alone. The business does not break, but the growth narrative supporting the current multiple weakens significantly.

**Bear case rating: MODERATE**

The business is sound, management is clean, and the structural thesis is intact. The bear case is primarily a valuation bear case: at 37.5× P/E with a market cap above NT$30B, PDC does not offer the 5× asymmetric return the framework requires. The multiple must expand substantially AND revenue must accelerate substantially for the framework's return threshold to be met. That requires a re-rating event — most likely a bulge-bracket initiation or a hyperscaler supply agreement announcement — that is not currently visible.

---

## SECTION 14 — GEOPOLITICAL DIMENSION

**Verdict: NEUTRAL (with managed headwinds)**

**Supply chain through China:** PDC operates manufacturing facilities in both Taiwan (Taoyuan, Yangmei) and mainland China (Yongzhou, Wujiang/Suzhou area). This dual footprint creates exposure to cross-strait tensions and the US-China technology trade conflict.

**Chinese export controls:** PDC's key input, barium titanate, is synthesised from barium carbonate and titanium dioxide, both of which are commodities available from multiple global sources. These are not currently subject to Chinese export restrictions. The rare earth dopants used in high-performance formulations (dysprosium, holmium) are more exposed to Chinese export control risk — China controls approximately 80–85% of global rare earth processing. The October 2025 Chinese export control expansion (subsequently partially suspended under a one-year agreement) creates latent risk.

**Friendshoring benefit:** Taiwan's positioning in the Western supply chain, combined with PDC's status as the only non-Japanese, non-Chinese significant dielectric powder producer, makes PDC a natural beneficiary of any customer seeking to reduce Japan and China supply dependencies. No formal CHIPS Act or IRA incentive applies to a Taiwanese company, but the geopolitical logic of "Taiwan as trusted partner" is directionally positive.

**Export control risk:** PDC's finished MLCCs and dielectric powders do not appear to be on any restricted list. No revenue exposure to sanctioned Chinese entities is disclosed. The company's China operations present dual-use compliance complexity but no identified revenue-at-risk from current controls.

**China revenue exposure:** PDC's China plants serve primarily Chinese domestic consumption and supply into global supply chains from a Chinese manufacturing base. Cross-strait risk is a binary tail risk, not a probability-weighted annual drag. The scale of financial exposure is difficult to quantify from public data.

**Verdict: NEUTRAL.** Friendshoring logic is a modest tailwind. Rare earth input risk and cross-strait tail risk are manageable headwinds. No existential geopolitical threat identified.

## SECTION 15 — INSTITUTIONAL ROTATION TIMING

**Phase mapping:** PDC sits at the intersection of Phase 3 (2025–2026, early innings) and a precursor to Phase 4. The institutional rotation into speciality materials and passive components feeding AI infrastructure is beginning but is not yet consensual. Phase 1 (memory) and Phase 2 (optical transceivers) are largely complete. PDC's materials-layer thesis aligns with Phase 3 discovery dynamics.

**Institutional ownership:** Low relative to strategic importance. No bulge-bracket Western initiation identified. Primary ownership is Taiwanese domestic retail and regional institutional.

**Most likely discovery catalyst:**
- A >20% quarterly earnings beat that draws Taiwanese broker attention and generates a research note picked up by international aggregators.
- A confirmed supply agreement with a major PSU manufacturer that traces publicly to a hyperscaler.
- The Liujia plant commissioning generating a press release that signals step-change capacity.
- A sector-wide note from a bulge-bracket firm (JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs) on Taiwanese passive component supply constraints that names PDC specifically.

**Time to institutional consensus:** 18+ months. The stock is too small, too locally-listed, and too opaque for rapid institutional discovery.

**Risk that rotation has already occurred:** Partially. The stock has re-rated from the 2023 trough. The trailing P/E of 37.5× tells you domestic Taiwanese investors have already recognised the recovery story. What has not happened is Western institutional discovery of the powder moat thesis. That is the remaining information asymmetry.

## SYNTHESIS: THE ONE-PARAGRAPH PITCH

PDC (6173.TW) is the only Taiwanese domestic producer of MLCC-grade ceramic dielectric powder — the material without which a multilayer ceramic capacitor cannot be manufactured — and simultaneously operates a vertically integrated MLCC line that converts that powder into finished NP0/C0G and X7R components now replacing film and aluminium capacitors inside the 3kW–8kW power supply units of NVIDIA GB200 and H200 AI server racks. The company controls approximately 5–10% of global dielectric powder volume, is the sole non-Japanese, non-Chinese significant powder producer, and has achieved the rare distinction of qualifying into the Japanese supply chain — a certification that takes 12–18 months and confirms formulation quality at world-class standards. AI-related revenue grew to 6.5% of sales in Q1 2026, with management targeting 10% for the full year; Q1 2026 net income grew 70% YoY on 7.7% revenue growth, confirming operating leverage is real. Total assets grew 27.5% in 2025. The business trades at approximately USD 1.0B market cap on NT$32.96B, a net cash EV of NT$19.82B, but the trailing P/E of 37.5× is the central problem: the recovery story is already in the price, the return maths do not produce 5× from today's entry point under a reasonable bull case, and until a bulge-bracket initiation or a confirmed Tier 1 hyperscaler supply agreement is announced, PDC scores **8/13 (Tier 2)** — a high-quality business in the right part of the supply chain at the wrong entry price for maximum asymmetric returns. The thesis requires either a meaningful price correction or a step-change catalyst before a full position is justified.

## RESEARCH LIMITATIONS

1. Earnings call transcripts in English are unavailable for this Taiwanese mid-cap. All forward management language is inferred from Digitimes reporting and company IR press releases — this is the most significant evidence gap in the analysis.
2. Customer concentration and revenue segmentation (powder vs. finished MLCC) are not disclosed publicly. The powder thesis is the primary moat, but the revenue contribution of powder vs. assembled components cannot be verified.
3. Gross margin by segment is not disclosed. Operating leverage is inferred from net income growth rates.
4. Q4 2025 and full-year 2025 quarterly breakdown is estimated; only Q1–Q3 2025 quarterly data confirmed.
